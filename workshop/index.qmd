# Welcome to the Intertidal Curriculum Pilot Program

Welcome to the **Intertidal Curriculum Pilot Program**, where we combine place-based intertidal ecology education with open-source digital arts to foster learning, creativity, and community connection.

## About the Program

This pilot program is designed for high school students historically excluded from coastal environments. Our two-week curriculum:

- Builds foundational intertidal ecology knowledge.
- Develops digital storytelling skills using open-source platforms like DaVinci Resolve.
