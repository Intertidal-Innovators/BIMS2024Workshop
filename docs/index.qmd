Welcome to the **Innovating Science & Art Education**, where we combine place-based intertidal ecology education with open-source digital arts to foster learning, creativity, and community connection.

## About the Program

This pilot program is designed for high school students historically excluded from coastal environments. Our two-week curriculum is concentrated from the 5-week program we ran in Summer 2024 and features: \
- Integration of science, digital storytelling, and cultural responsiveness. \
- Building foundational intertidal ecology knowledge. \
- Developing digital storytelling skills using open-source platforms like [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/) and [Echoes](https://echoes.xyz/)
