title: Ecology & Art Lessons 
---

### This 6 day schedule balances the science and the art learning and application utilizing the %E's method of curricula building. It also incorporates 3 community building activities per day. We intend this content to be used in tandem with the culturally responsive teaching topics to round out the 2-week program window.
