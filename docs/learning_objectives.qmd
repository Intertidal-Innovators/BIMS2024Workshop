Program Overview

This two-week immersive program combines foundational knowledge of intertidal ecology with hands-on digital storytelling skills. Students will explore the intertidal ecosystem, focusing on biodiversity, adaptations, and ecological interactions while developing creative digital projects to communicate their findings. By the end of the program, students will have a comprehensive understanding of marine ecology and a polished digital project to showcase their learning.

Learning Objectives

Understand the fundamentals of intertidal ecology, including biodiversity, adaptations, and ecological interactions.

Develop skills in scientific observation, field sampling, and tidepool etiquette.

Gain proficiency in digital tools like Canva and DaVinci Resolve for storytelling.

Communicate complex ecological concepts through creative media.

Reflect on human impacts on intertidal ecosystems and advocate for marine conservation.
