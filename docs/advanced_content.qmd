Advanced Intertidal Ecology Curriculum

Overview
This six-day curriculum is designed for students with an introductory understanding of intertidal ecology who want to deepen their knowledge. Using advanced ecological topics, students will explore concepts like succession, predation, competition, nutrient cycling, disturbance, and biogeography. Each lesson follows the 5E model (Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, Evaluate) to scaffold learning and encourage critical thinking.



Learning Objectives

Understand the ecological processes that shape intertidal communities, including succession, predation, competition, and disturbance.

Analyze nutrient cycling and its role in intertidal ecosystem functioning.

Evaluate how biogeography and dispersal influence intertidal community composition and diversity.

Develop skills in scientific observation, data analysis, and hypothesis testing.

Synthesize complex ecological concepts into actionable conservation insights.



Day 1: Succession in the Intertidal

Overview: Introduce students to the concept of succession, focusing on its stages, drivers, and effects on intertidal community dynamics.

Engage: Show a time-lapse video of a tidepool recovering after a disturbance. Discuss initial observations.

Explore: Field activity: Observe and document a tidepool, identifying organisms at different successional stages.

Explain: Lecture on primary and secondary succession, wave action, sedimentation, and competition as drivers.

Elaborate: Create diagrams showing predicted successional changes after disturbances like storms.

Evaluate: Group presentations on their tidepool findings and predicted successional stages.



Day 2: Predation and Herbivory

Overview: Examine predator-prey and herbivore-plant dynamics in intertidal zones, emphasizing keystone species.

Engage: Play a predator-prey simulation game (e.g., students role-play as organisms in a tidepool).

Explore: Quadrat sampling: Identify predators, herbivores, and their food sources.

Explain: Discuss predator-prey dynamics, trophic cascades, and the role of keystone species (e.g., sea stars).

Elaborate: Model a food web showing how the removal of a predator or herbivore could impact the ecosystem.

Evaluate: Write a short analysis predicting the outcome of a specific predator-prey interaction change.



Day 3: Competition in Intertidal Communities

Overview: Explore the role of competition in shaping the distribution and abundance of organisms in intertidal zones.

Engage: Show a video or images of mussel beds competing for space and discuss initial thoughts.

Explore: Conduct a space allocation experiment using simulated quadrats to measure organism competition for space.

Explain: Lecture on interference vs. exploitative competition, competitive exclusion, and niche differentiation.

Elaborate: Debate: Which is more influential in shaping intertidal communities—competition or predation?

Evaluate: Submit a reflective journal entry on how competition influences their field observations.



Day 4: Nutrient Cycling

Overview: Study the pathways of nutrient cycling in intertidal ecosystems and their influence on ecosystem health.

Engage: Demonstrate nutrient flow using colored water to show tidal cycles and sediment mixing.

Explore: Sample sediment and water for signs of nutrient activity (e.g., algae presence, water clarity).

Explain: Discuss nitrogen and phosphorus cycling, algae-bacteria interactions, and tidal influences.

Elaborate: Create concept maps linking nutrient pathways to ecosystem functioning and organism health.

Evaluate: Students design an experiment to test nutrient cycling impacts (e.g., fertilizer runoff effects).

Day 5: Disturbance and Resilience

Overview: Investigate the role of disturbance in maintaining intertidal biodiversity and shaping community resilience.

Engage: Discuss case studies of major intertidal disturbances (e.g., oil spills, storms).

Explore: Field activity: Identify signs of past disturbances (e.g., scars on rock surfaces, dead zones).

Explain: Lecture on types of disturbances and their ecological impacts.

Elaborate: Create resilience plans for hypothetical disturbances affecting local intertidal zones.

Evaluate: Group presentations on their resilience strategies.



Day 6: Biogeography and Dispersal

Overview: Explore how intertidal organisms disperse and how geographic factors shape species distribution.

Engage: Map known distributions of key intertidal species and hypothesize dispersal mechanisms.

Explore: Simulate larval dispersal using floating markers in water to show currents’ effects.

Explain: Lecture on larval development, ocean currents, and habitat availability.

Elaborate: Analyze how biogeography affects conservation priorities in the intertidal.

Evaluate: Write a final reflection connecting biogeographic patterns to observed field data.
